<p>
Here I keep structured notes on my explorations, shaped both by professional and personal experiences.
</p>

<h3>Primary Interest: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, Cryptography and Data Privacy</h3>
<p>
I am interested in developing secure and practical methods that protect sensitive data in machine learning and unlearning systems. 
My motivation comes from working with real-world data where privacy and usability often collide—whether in healthcare or finance. 
These experiences led me to focus on privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and cryptography as fundamental tools for building trustworthy AI systems.

<h3>Broader Interests: Animal and Human Communication</h3>
<p>
Beyond my core research, I am fascinated by how AI can help us better understand communication across species. 
After raising dogs for many years, I became curious about animal communication, service dogs, and broader human–animal interaction. 
This curiosity now extends to AI for animals, human activity recognition (HAR) and multimodal learning, where language, vision, and behavior intersect. 
I am currently exploring these interests through seminars and research activities such as DS@GT’s preparation for LifeCLEF 2026.
