## ✨ About
I am a researcher at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmlclab/research" target="_blank">Privacy‑preserving Machine Learning and Cryptography Lab (PMLC Lab)</a>, supervised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pmlclab/home" target="_blank">Prof. Eunsang Lee (이은상)</a>. I am currently preparing projects on cryptographic techniques for privacy-preserving AI systems.

### 🔍 Research interests
- **Privacy‑Preserving Machine Learning (PPML):** training and unlearning under privacy constraints 
- **Cryptographic Techniques:** homomorphic encryption and related methods for secure learning
- **Data Privacy:** balancing confidentiality and utility in real-world AI
