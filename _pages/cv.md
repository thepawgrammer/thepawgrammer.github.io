Research Goals
=====
Researcher at the [Privacy-preserving Machine Learning and Cryptography Lab (PMLC Lab)](https://sites.google.com/view/pmlclab/research), under the supervision of [Prof. Eunsang Lee (이은상)](https://sites.google.com/view/pmlclab/home). My research broadly focuses on **privacy-preserving machine learning** and **cryptography**, with applications to sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance. Motivated by the belief that technology should safeguard people’s everyday peace and expand opportunities to learn and dream, I aim to advance secure and practical methods for future AI systems.  
<span style="color:gray">  
저는 기술이 사람들의 일상을 지키고, 모두가 더 큰 꿈을 그릴 수 있도록 돕는 역할을 해야 한다고 믿습니다.  
특히 의료나 금융과 같이 민감한 영역에서 **프라이버시 보호 머신러닝**과 **암호학**을 결합하여,  
보다 안전하고 실용적인 AI 시스템을 만들어가는 것을 제 연구 목표로 삼고 있습니다.
