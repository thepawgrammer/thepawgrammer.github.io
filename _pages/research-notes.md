Here I keep structured notes on my explorations, shaped both by professional and personal experiences.

### Primary Interest: Data Privacy, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning
My focus on privacy-preserving machine learning and cryptography grew out of my professional experiences. While working with patient data in a hospital, I saw firsthand the difficulty of protecting sensitive information while enabling analysis. Later, in the financial sector, I observed strict data regulations but also the practical challenges of enforcing them. These experiences convinced me that privacy is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge, motivating me to study PPML in greater depth.

### Broader Interests: Animal and Human Communication
Outside my primary research, I draw from personal experiences. After raising dogs for 17 years, I became fascinated by animal communication and health. This expanded to an interest in service dogs, and eventually to the study of human–animal interaction and human behavior. These interests now guide my participation in seminars on animal communication and HAR, and my involvement in DS@GT’s preparation for LifeCLEF 2026.
