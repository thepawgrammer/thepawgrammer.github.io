**Summary:**  
In this lab meeting, I reviewed *HETAL: Efficient Privacy-preserving Transfer Learning with Homomorphic Encryption*. Transfer learning is widely used for data-scarce problems by fine-tuning pre-trained models. While previous studies focused mainly on encrypted inference, HETAL is the **first practical scheme** that enables encrypted training under homomorphic encryption.

üîë **Research Question:**  
  - *How can transfer learning be made both privacy-preserving and efficient when client data must remain encrypted?*  

‚öôÔ∏è **Key Mechanism:**  
  - **Encrypted Softmax Approximation**: Designed a highly precise softmax approximation algorithm compatible with HE constraints.  
  - **Efficient Matrix Multiplication**: Introduced an encrypted matrix multiplication algorithm, 1.8√ó‚Äì323√ó faster than prior methods.   
  - **End-to-end Encrypted Training**: Adopted validation-based early stopping, achieving accuracy comparable to plaintext training.  

üìä **Main Results:**  
  - Fine-tuning on encrypted models succeeded (a new milestone compared to prior work).   
  - Training times ranged 567‚Äì3442 seconds (< 1 hour) across five benchmark datasets.   
  - Accuracy comparable to non-encrypted training was achieved.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:**  
  - Accuracy degradation in certain tasks due to approximation constraints.  
  - Evaluation limited to moderate-sized models/datasets.
