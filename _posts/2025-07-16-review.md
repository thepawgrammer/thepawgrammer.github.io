## 📌 Why I Chose This Paper

From my experience in hospitals and banks, data privacy concerns often make it difficult ot even access the data needed for machine learning, since sensitive information, like patient records, or financial transaction histories, must be handled with extreme caution.
This paper tackles an essential question:

> Can we train models on encrypted data, not just infer with them?

Most prior homomorphic encryption (HE)-based work focused on **inference only**.  
But this paper shows it's practically possible to perform **training (fine-tuning)** on encrypted features — within **1 hour**, and with **comparable accuracy** to plaintext training.

## 🔍 Research Question

**How can we efficiently outsource fine-tuning in a privacy-preserving way using homomorphic encryption (HE)?**

## 🔐 What HETAL Proposes

HETAL (Homomorphic Encryption-based Transfer Learning) introduces a **practical encrypted training protocol** using **leveled homomorphic encryption (CKKS)** where:

1. The **client** extracts features using a pre-trained model and **encrypts them** using CKKS.
2. The **server** fine-tunes a classification layer **without decrypting** the data.
3. A novel **encrypted early stopping mechanism** enables efficient training termination based on validation loss.

> ➕ The client doesn't need ML expertise.  
> ➖ The server never sees raw data or final model weights.
