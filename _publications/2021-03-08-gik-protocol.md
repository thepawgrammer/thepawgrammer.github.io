### TL;DR
Validated a **standardized GIK infusion protocol** using real-world clinical data from a hospital data warehouse, showing reduced protocol variability and improved monitoring feasibility.

### My Role
- Preprocessed and analyzed Electronic Medical Record (EMR) datasets (7,000+ patients) for endocrinology studies.  
- Built cohort and feature pipelines; performed statistical analyses for protocol validation.  
- Co-wrote the methods and results sections and prepared figures/tables.

### Methods / Data
- Retrospective analysis of EHR from a clinical data warehouse; adult surgical patients receiving GIK.  
- Statistical comparisons of glucose control and safety endpoints across protocol variants.

### Results / Impact
- Protocol standardization decreased practice variability and supported safer perioperative glucose management.  
- Provided a replicable data pipeline for future protocol audits in the department.
