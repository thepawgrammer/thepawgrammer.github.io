요약: 임상 데이터 웨어하우스 기반으로 **표준화된 GIK 주입 프로토콜**을 검증했습니다. 특히 프로토콜 간 변동성을 줄여서 프로토콜의 안전성 모니터링의 유효성을 확인했습니다. 제 역할은 전자 의무 기록 (Electronic Medical Record, EMR) 데이터의 전처리·분석, 결과 정리 및 도표 제작이었습니다.

### ⚡️ TL;DR
Validated a **standardized GIK infusion protocol** using real-world clinical data from a hospital data warehouse, showing reduced protocol variability and improved monitoring feasibility.

### 👩🏻‍💻 My Role
- Preprocessed and analyzed **7,000+ Electronic Medical Record (EMR)** datasets for endocrinology research.  
- Built cohort and feature pipelines; performed **statistical analyses** for protocol validation.  
- Co-wrote the methods and results sections; prepared figures/tables.

### 🧪 Methods / Data
- Retrospective analysis of EMR from a clinical data warehouse. 
- Statistical comparisons of glucose control and safety endpoints across protocol variants.

### 📊 Results / Impact
- Protocol standardization **decreased variability** in glucose management.  
- Improved perioperative safety and provided a **replicable data pipeline** for future audits.
