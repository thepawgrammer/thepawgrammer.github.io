### 🔐 **1. Everyone deserves a safe and peaceful daily life.**

> 🛡️ *“Peace in our daily life shouldn’t be compromised by the future.”*

As quantum computers become powerful enough to break traditional encryption,  
they may threaten the digital infrastructure that supports our everyday lives —  
from banking systems to sensitive medical records.

I believe it is crucial to prepare **now**,  
so that no matter how fast technology advances,  
our personal safety and sense of stability will remain intact.

I want to contribute to a future where people can continue to enjoy peace of mind —  
**in both the digital and physical worlds.**

### 🌱 **2. A hopeful society begins with people who are free to dream.**

> ✨ *“When dreams disappear, so does the energy that moves society forward.”*
{: .prompt-tip }

When people lose their dreams, society loses its vitality.  
I want to help create a world where no one gives up hope  
because of fear, inequality, or lack of opportunity.

A hopeful society — where everyone feels empowered to pursue their own vision of the future —  
is the foundation for **true progress** and **well-being**.

### 🎓 **3. Learning should be joyful, simple, and open to everyone.**

> 💡 *“Knowledge becomes powerful when it’s shared freely and joyfully.”*
{: .prompt-tip }

I believe learning doesn't have to be formal or complicated.  
Sometimes, all it takes is a spark of curiosity, a friendly explanation,  
or a visual story to make complex ideas feel approachable.

Through creative and accessible content — like comics and videos —  
I hope to make learning **less intimidating** and **more inviting**,  
especially for those who’ve been discouraged or left out by traditional education systems.
