### 🔐 **1. Everyone deserves a safe and peaceful daily life.**

> 🛡️ *“Let the future advance — but never at the cost of our everyday peace.”*
{: .prompt-tip }

As quantum computers become powerful enough to break traditional encryption,  
they may put our everyday lives at risk — threatening the systems we rely on,  
from personal communication to medical records and financial services.

That’s why I believe we need to act **now**,  
to ensure that no matter how advanced technology becomes,  
people’s safety and peace of mind will never be compromised.

I want to contribute to a future where people can continue to enjoy peace of mind —  
in a world where technology protects us, not threatens us.

### 🌱 **2. A hopeful society begins with people who are free to dream.**

> ✨ *“When dreams disappear, so does the energy that moves society forward.”*
{: .prompt-tip }

When people lose their dreams, society loses its vitality.  
I want to help create a world where no one gives up hope  
because of fear, inequality, or lack of opportunity.

A hopeful society — where everyone feels empowered to pursue their own vision of the future —  
is the foundation for **true progress** and **well-being**.

### 🎓 **3. Learning should be joyful, simple, and open to everyone.**

> 💡 *“Knowledge becomes powerful when it’s shared freely and joyfully.”*
{: .prompt-tip }

I believe learning doesn't have to be formal or complicated.  
Sometimes, all it takes is a spark of curiosity, a friendly explanation,  
or a visual story to make complex ideas feel approachable.

Through creative and accessible content — like comics and videos —  
I hope to make learning **less intimidating** and **more inviting**,  
especially for those who’ve been discouraged or left out by traditional education systems.

> 📌 **한글 요약:**  
> 저는 배움이 재미있고, 쉽고, 모두에게 열려 있어야 한다고 믿습니다. 만화나 영상처럼 직관적인 방식으로 지식을 전함으로써, 누구나 부담 없이 공부를 시작할 수 있도록 돕고 싶습니다.
